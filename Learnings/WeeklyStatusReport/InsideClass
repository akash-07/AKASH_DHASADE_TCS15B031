What you learnt inside the class?

Week 1

#1 Missed all the lectures this week as I had to go home due to some work, looking forward positively to learn a lot the coming week!

Week 2

#1 Learnt about different paradigms of programming like functional, imperative, logical, scripting, etc. 
#2 Came to know more about compilers and interpreters and many more things like BNF, AST, tokenizers,etc. Understood syntax and semantics
more precisely.
#3 Pondered over questions like wehther we can design languages such that they are more error free or can compilers be made in such a way
that program debugging and correctness is bettered?

Week 3

#1 Learnt a bit about Python and more about Haskell. The way Siddarth explained gave me a new outlook to Haskell. Reliased that there's a 
way more to be discovered in Haskell.

Week 4

#1 Holiday on 26th Jan, so nothing much learnt inside the class.

week 5

#1 Got an overview of different languages as the presentations were held in the class.
