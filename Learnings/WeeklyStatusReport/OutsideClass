What you learnt outside the class?

Week 1

#1 This was the first time I realized that not only so many languages like haskell,rust,swift,go,etc. exist but also that they are equally 
widely used as C,C++ and Java.
#2 Realized that coding is not all that you have to do being a CSE UG and was amazed by the wide scope of computer science as a discipline
when I looked at the Turing award articles.
#3 Spent some time learning 'Haskell' as a new functional programming language. Learnt about basic lists, tuples, recursion, datatypes and 
functions in Haskell. Realized the fact that Haskell is 'lazy' languauge wherein we can define infinite lists unlike C,C++ which is not 
actually created until you ask haskell for a result. 
#4 Read first two chapters from the book 'Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!'.

Week 2

#1 Actually nothing much due to busy schedule throughout the week but ya learnt about summarizing Turing award articles and using Latex to 
present the same.
